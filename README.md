- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Renata, a freshly graduated Junior Backend Developer.
- ðŸŒ± At the moment I'm deepening my knowledge in a Spring Boot E-Commerce Ultimate Course, and CS50: Introduction to Computer Science.
- ðŸ’¼ I'm currently on a look out for a role in backend webdevelopment, ideally writting in Java.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm also a ceritfied pychologist, but recently I switched professions. I'm still very much interested in the human psychÃ© but I'm also into developing and creating usable applications and websites. Later on I hope I can combine these two interest of mine.
- ðŸ“« Feel free to reach me on LinkedIn, let's chat! [in/renatavegh](https://pages.github.com/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renatavegh/)
