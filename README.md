- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Renata, a Junior Backend Developer, a Junior Software Test Automation Engineer.
- ðŸŒ± At the moment I'm deepening my knowledge in .NET.
- ðŸ’¼ I'm currently on the lookout for a role in backend development, ideally writing in C# or Java, but I'm open to trying out new technologies as well.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm also a ceritfied pychologist, but recently I switched professions. I'm still very much interested in the human psyche but I'm also into developing and creating usable applications and websites. Later on I hope I can combine these two interest of mine.
- ðŸ“« Feel free to reach me on LinkedIn, let's chat! [in/renatavegh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renatavegh/)
